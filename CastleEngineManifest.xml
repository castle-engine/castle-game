        Disable some deprecation warnings from CGE, we knowingly use some
        deprecated stuff.
        We should eventually fix (upgrade) them, but it's not a priority for now,
        I can just fix deprecated stuff when it breaks,
        and castle-game project code is not advised to learn CGE now.
