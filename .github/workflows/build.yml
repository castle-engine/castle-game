# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub Actions workflow to build this application
# using latest Castle Game Engine snapshot for multiple platforms.
#
# Uses GitHub-hosted runners, i.e. you don't need to set up any server infrastructure,
# GitHub provides it all for free for open-source projects.
#
# See https://castle-engine.io/github_actions and https://docs.github.com/en/actions for docs.
#
# TODO:
# - wrap in new GH action, https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions
# - release artifacts as GH release (with some tag, or draft, to clearly communicate this is snapshot)
#   Use GH cli for release?
#   https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_upload
#     gh release upload --clobber snapshot *-win64-x86_64.zip *-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
#     but it will not work in our Docker?
#     and it will not clobber files when version number or project name changes. Remove version number?

  # Build for platforms supported by
  # CGE Docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/kambi/castle-engine-cloud-builds-tools/ .
  #
  # Since setting up Docker image takes majority of time (5-6 mins)
  # compared to actually getting and compiling CGE (1 min)
  # and building application (~1 min for each platform),
  # we build all platforms possible within one job.
